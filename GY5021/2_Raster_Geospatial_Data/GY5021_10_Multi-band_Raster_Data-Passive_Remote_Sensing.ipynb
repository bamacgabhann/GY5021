    "# Multi-band Raster Data: Passive Remote Sensing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *Introduction to Raster Data* Notebook, we used a satellite photograph as our first step in working with raster data. In the *Single-band Raster Data* Notebook, we then looked at rasters with a single band or dataset - elevation data first, and then temperature data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the photographs we used in the *Introduction to Raster Data* Notebook actually had three bands, not just a single band - one band each for red, green, and blue colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually multi-band passive remote sensing data, the subject of this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the photographs how each raster had separate arrays for red, green and blue - that's our three bands, hence multi-band. But what do I mean by *passive remote sensing?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The *sensing* part is using an instrument to collect data. A camera counts: it has a sensor which records values for the intensity of red, green, and blue light collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *remote* part simply means \"at a distance\". We're not taking a reading in contact with the object we're measuring, like when we put a ruler across something to measure it's size. We're doing it from far away. A satellite is pretty far above the Earth when it takes a photo: that definitely counts as remote. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *passive* part means that the instrument is not transmitting a signal - just receiving. The satellite taking the photograph isn't shining a light onto the Earth - it's taking advantage of another source of light. The sun illuminates the Earth, and some of the sunlight is reflected from the ground back into space, where it can be collected by cameras on satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take a step back here, and think about everything which has to happen in order for a remote sensing instrument to receive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A source of energy emits that energy\n",
    "2. That energy travels from the source to the target\n",
    "3. The energy interacts in some way with the target\n",
    "4. The energy travels from the target to the sensor\n",
    "5. The sensor records the energy as data\n",
    "6. The data is processed\n",
    "7. The processed data is analysed\n",
    "\n",
    "For most remote sensing, the energy is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. That's absolutely not always the case - seismographs measure vibrations (basically sound energy) to monitor earthquakes, and seismic surveys by oil and gas companies do the same. Some satellites measure gravity. We won't be looking at any of that data, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electromagnetic spectrum includes the visible light we can see; plus higher-energy ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays; and lower energy infrared and radio waves. There are passive remote sensing instruments across this entire range: however, some of these like X-rays and gamma rays are mostly used in astronomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we will focus on visible and infrared light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of energy in passive remote sensing of visible and infrared light is, as we said, the Sun. So, breaking down into our list again:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sun emits energy.\n",
    "The Sun emits energy across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. There's some minor details if you're interested in solar astronomy, but for our purposes, we don't have to worry about this. It's not a case that the Sun emits more green light than red light: for our purposes, we can consider it essentially even, as white light.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some of that energy travels to Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel from the Sun to Earth is mostly insignificant; however, once the signal reaches Earth, it has to travel through the atmosphere before reaching the ground. This does have some effects; some light bounces off air molecules in the atmosphere, mostly blue light - which is why the sky is blue when you look up - well, unless it's cloudy, I suppose. Which is really the major issue - clouds block the light, and satellite photographs of a cloudy area will just show...clouds. Not the ground surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll skip a step here to note that the same thing will happen at:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Energy travels from the target to the sensor.\n",
    "For satellite sensors, the energy must travel all the way back through the atmosphere. There are other remote sensing platforms - aircraft and UAVs can take photographs using the light that manages to get through the clouds, and can sit below clouds so they don't need to worry about them. There's also instruments like cameras which can be used on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When the data is received by the sensor, of course the sensitivity and resolution of the sensor control what can be recorded. Again, we can use the example of a camera, and remember how good cameras on phones are now compared to over a decade ago - more megapixels means better data, and similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The processing is not something most people working with data really need to get into - but the first stage would be things like adding geographic information. There can also be correction to account for the effects of passing through the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The analysis is the bit that we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The skipped step is crucial, though:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The energy interacts with the target.\n",
    "This is the key step. There's essentially three things which can happen here.\n",
    "    1. The energy can be *transmitted*, passing through the target completely.\n",
    "    2. The energy can be *absorbed* by the target.\n",
    "    3. The energy can be *reflected* by the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed an example of transmitted energy in the Single-Band Raster Data Notebook - how some RADAR signals can pass through tree canopies. This will then reach another target - in that case, the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the signal is ultimately absorbed or reflected is something we have a word for, when it comes to visible light: colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plants are green because they *reflect* green light, but *absorb* blue and red light. So when white light from the sun hits a plant, we see only the reflected green light. Similarly, tomatoes are red because they absorb the green and blue but reflect the red light. Objects which are other colours reflect some combinations, for example purple objects reflect both red and blue. White objects reflect all light, and black objects absorb it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "But - this only refers to the visible colours we can see. What about the infrared?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly the same thing happens - we just can't see it. But we have sensors which can. "

    "## 1. Multispectral Imaging (MSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The satellite image we used for Killarney in the *Introduction to Raster Data* Notebook wasn't actually a true photograph. It was a combination of red, green, and blue bands collected by one of the Sentinel-2 satellites, part of the EU's Copernicus Earth Observation programme. The Sentinel-2 satellites don't just collect visible light - they are *Multispectral Imaging* satellites, which actually collect data in 13 different bands. As well as red, green, and blue visible light, there's one band at the ultraviolet edge of blue light, and nine different bands of infrared light. You can think of this as nine different infrared colours.\n",

    "Three things to say here. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, only bands 01-04 are visible light. B01 captures a narrow region at the UV edge of blue light; and B02, B03, and B04 are our blue, green, and red light.  I've shown these in appropriate colours. B05 and B06 are on the edge between red and infrared, and the other bands are fully infrared 'colours': and I've shown those in grey above because we don't have a colour language for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the visible light spectrum and the near and shortwave infrared, with the ranges of the Sentinel 2 bands:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamacgabhann/GY5021/2024/GY5021/2_Raster_Geospatial_Data/sample_data/S2_bands.png\" align=center alt=\"Sentinel 2 band ranges\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the images above, you should be able to see that different parts of the area are lighter or darker in that particular colour - and the patterns are not identical across all of the images. What's lighter in some is darker than others; some features are visible on one image, but not another. This is because different objects have different colours, whether in visible or infrared light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you might notice that there is no Band 10 image in the maps above. This is because the data I've given here as the sample has been processed to what's referred to as *L2A* (Level 2 A). It's not crucial to understand all the data processing steps, but *L1C* (Level 1 C) data is essentially the data processed to the correct geographic area, with no further corrections; *L2A* data has been further processed to remove the effects of the signal travelling through the atmosphere. Band 10 is used for looking *at* the atmosphere - so the *L2A* correction essentially removes all data from Band 10, hence why it isn't shown above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, this is a rather awkward way of showing everything - I have to specify each image individually. That's fine for a one off, but if I want to do more with it, it's going to get awkward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the images is a raster which stores only a single band. But it's all showing the same area - so why not make it a single multiband raster? That's really what it is."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, through all the raster data so far we've actually been exploring data relevant to the Killarney wildfire of April 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We started with photographs (actually bands 04, 03, and 02 from the Sentinel 2 satellite);\n",
    "- We brought in a DEM of the area;\n",
    "- We looked at the land surface temperatures in the area for that month (maximum of 12°C, according to our data);\n",
    "- We looked at the NDVI to see vegetation in the area (not great in the fire area, but that's mostly *after* the fire);\n",
    "- We looked at the NDMI for vegetation moisture (pretty dry in the fire area);\n",
    "- Finally, we extracted the shape of the active fires at the time the imagery was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If wildfires is what you're interested in, there's plenty more you can do there. We could also have tried to extract the shape of the burned area - and you can see that pretty clearly on the RGB imagery. We could look at vegetation and moisture *before* wildfires, and find other places with similar vegetation and moisture which could be at risk of wildfires. We could assess the vegetation before and after the wildfire to look at the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is only one example of how remote sensing data can be used in environmental geospatial data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing imagery can also be used to help assess biodiversity, to monitor agriculture, to look at flooding, to map landslides, to assess water quality, to measure snow and ice cover, and to map land use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even when I was doing my PhD, remote sensing data was *very* hard to work with, and not easy to get. Now? With the massive advance in computation power, as well as resources like Colab, analysis of the data has become possible for essentially anyone who wants to try. Even more importantly, we all have access to some absolutely incredible datasets. Sentinel 2A was launched in 2015, and *all* of its data is open access. Most data from the US civilian agencies is open access now as well, including LANDSAT and MODIS, and there's data available from other countries as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "And that's just the multispectral satellites. In the EU's Copernicus programme, there's also Sentinel 3 monitoring the oceans, Sentinel 5P monitoring the atmosphere and air pollution, and Sentinel 6 to measure sea level change - and Sentinel 1, which uses RADAR for earth observation. That's up next week for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to access the data is through the <a href='https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/'>Copernicus Browser</a>. Copernicus is the EU's Earth Observation programme - registration is required, but it's free. US data is available from <a href='https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/'>USGS Earth Explorer</a> or <a href='https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search'>NASA Earthdata</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the availability of data, and the computing resources available to use it, the possibilities are virtually limitless. It's just a case of, what do you want to do with it?"
