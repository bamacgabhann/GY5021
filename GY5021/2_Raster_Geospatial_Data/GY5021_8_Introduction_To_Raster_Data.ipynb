Our eyes can distinguish the differences in the 4- and 6-bit images, and while above that we can't see much difference - computers can distinguish *far* more than our eyes. If you're trying to do complex analysis of imagery on a computer, then even the differences between 8-bit integers and 32-bit floats is enormous, and can make a very significant difference in the analysis.\n",

How good your results will be depends on this - and it's really just a case of understanding the limits of what you have. There's no point trying to do fine-scale spectral analysis on data with a low spectral resolution, just as there's no point trying to map parking spaces, for example, on data with a spatial resolution of 10m - you just won't be able to see the differences."

    "The key takeaways here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image-type geospatial data is not used in vector format, but in raster format, where coordinates and a transform are specified for an entire array of pixels instead of giving the coordinates for each pixel separately.\n",
    "2. Since pixels cover a discrete area, they have a spatial resolution - what distance they cover over the ground, which can be different in north-south and east-west directions.\n",
    "3. The spectral resolution is the precision at which the data for each pixel is stored. This is just as important as spatial resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just actual images which can be presented in this raster format. Any data which varies discontinuously acruss an area can be stored as a raster, with other common examples including maps of temperature, rainfall, and, as we'll see in our next Notebook, the elevation of the land surface."
