    "# Single-band Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Introduction to Raster Data Notebook, we used the example of a photograph to introduce raster data stored as pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, photographs are not the only form of data which is best used in raster format. A photograph of the land surface can hold colour values in each pixel, but pixels aren't restricted to colours. Instead of colours, the value of each pixel can represent any data which varies discontinuously across an area. Examples include temperature data, rainfall, and the elevation of the land surface. Let's look at some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: unless you really want to learn the Python code, don't focus on trying to understand it - a lot of the plotting code tends to be quite fiddly. The concepts are what is important here, not how to do everything in Python. The same concepts apply to all GIS software."

    "## 1. Digital Elevation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In a digital elevation model (DEM), each pixel holds a value which represents the elevation of the ground surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of important things to note. First of all, pixels are not points. Each pixel covers an *area* of the ground surface. The value is best thought of as the average elevation of the ground area covered by the pixel. As we saw in the Introduction to Raster Data notebook, the spatial resolution of raster data can vary considerably, and it's really important to ensure that you know the resolution of the source data. It's entirely possible to process the data such that the actual pixels cover smaller areas than the original data, but analyses which need higher resolution data won't become valid if you simply increase the number of pixels in low spatial resolution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, what do I mean by the ground surface? At first glance that seems obvious, but - say I have elevation data for an area which includes a forest. Is my elevation data measuring the top of the forest canopy, or the land underneath the trees? What about an area with buildings on it - are we including the tops of buildings, or are they removed from the dataset to show the surface as it would be without them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this is that it varies. You can find all of these. In fact, digital elevation models are a key tool in forestry monitoring, where they'll want the top surface, but if you're doing geology the trees are just getting in your way and you don't need them. Similarly, urban geography often uses elevation models e.g. to track urban growth, but again if you want the natural surface, you don't want the buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are generally two categories of DEM. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *Digital Surface Model* or DSM will hold data on the elevation of whatever is the first surface to return data to the sensor. This will include forest canopies, buildings, bridges, and anything else present in the area big enough to return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Digital Terrain Model* or DTM, on the other hand, will only have data for the underlying terrain, as the name suggests. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth taking a moment here to think about how DEM models, whether DSM or DTM, are constructed. It's possible to make a DEM by manually measuring elevation at a bunch of points and making what's called an *interpolation* between them. This basically means estimating what's in between known points. Although early topographic maps were essentially constructed in this way, it's really not practical for high resolution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, high-resolution DEMs are constructed by collecting data from overhead surveys - by aircraft, by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, commonly known as drones), or by satellite. The aircraft, UAV, or satellite will have a sensor which sends a signal to the ground, and measures the time taken for that signal to be reflected back to the sensor from different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different kinds of sensor are used for DEMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *RADAR*\n",
    "    We're generally familiar with aircraft and ground stations using RADAR (Radio Detection And Ranging) to detect other aircraft by transmitting radio waves horizontally, and measure the time taken for the reflected signals to return. It's also possible to point a RADAR transmitter vertically, at the ground, and produce a DEM by measuring the signal which comes back. This can be done by any of aircraft, UAV, or satellite, but works best from satellite. (We'll come back to RADAR again, because it's useful for other things as well as DEMs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *LiDAR*\n",
    "    Instead of radio waves, we can also point a laser at the ground and measure the reflection. LiDAR (*Light Detection and Ranging*) is not so possible from satellites due to the distance, how the signals spread out and weaken, and how light can be affected by travelling through the atmosphere, but from aircraft and UAVs it can produce very high resolution data. UL Geography has just acquired a UAV with a LiDAR camera for use in research projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavelength of radio waves is much longer than that of light - if you're not familiar with wavelength, it's not crucial to understand right now, just think of it as the size of the signal pulse. There's a few different wavelengths used, which are generally referred to as lettered bands. Many are just used for cilivian and/or military aviation and similar purposes and we don't need to explain them, but in geospatial research three bands are commonly used. C-band RADAR has a wavelength around 6cm; there's also the shorter wavelength X-band, around 3cm, and the longer wavelenth L-band, around 24cm. Even longer P-band (up to 1m) wavelengths are sometimes used, but much rarer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why I'm explaining this is that the shorter wavelength X-band RADAR signals are reflected by the tops of trees, while the longer wavelength L-band RADAR signals are too big to be reflected by individual leaves and branches, and so pass through forest canopies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://detektia.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/what-is-sar-synthetic-aperture-radar.jpeg\" align=center alt=\"RADAR bands\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not something that's really crucial to consider most of the time, but it does mean that some RADAR DEMs will measure the terrain, while others will include the height of vegetation. \n",
    "\n",
    "LiDar, on the other hand, has a wavelength small enough to be reflected from leaves and branches. So, not only will it measure the top of the forest canopy, it will map details of that top surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both LiDAR and RADAR will include buildings - so if you want a true DSM without any anthropogenic (human-made) structures, they have to be removed from the dataset. This is rarely perfect, and you'll commonly see remnants of buildings as artefacts in DSM models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publicly available global DEMs reach a resolution of down to around 30m per pixel. Data with higher spatial resolution is generally only available for specific smaller areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "LiDAR data for parts of Ireland can be found on the <a href=\"https://dcenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b7c4b0e763964070ad69bf8c1572c9f5\">Open Topographic Data Viewer</a>, most of which has been collected by the OPW for flood risk and coastal monitoring purposes, and by TII (Transport Infrastructure Ireland) for road projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "RADAR DEMs covering Ireland are available from Copernicus (the EU's Earth Observation programme), specifically the <a href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/-/copernicus-dem-new-direct-data-download-access\">COP30 DEM</a>; the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM available from the <a href=\"https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/\">USGS Earth Explorer</a>; and ALOS World 3D DEM, available from <a href=\"https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/aw3d30/aw3d30_e.htm\">the Japanese space agency</a>. All have a spatial resolution of approximately 30m per pixel.\n",

    "The example below uses the Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the COP30 DEM."

    "So, we've seen here that we can use single-band rasters as digital elevation models, plotting on maps them using colour scales, and as hillshades, or both, and can layer vector data over them. We can also use the elevation values in calculations, including making flood risk maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also seen that we can use other data, such as temperatures, and used that data to try and understand pixel size and shape in rasters, particularly when combining datasets in different coordinate reference systems from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways here are using raster data for elevation and data like temperatures, the concept that we can do calculations with the data beyond just showing it on maps, and that we have to be a bit careful when using multiple rasters - matching CRS and resolution in order to do calculations, but bearing in mind that increasing the number of pixels doesn't increase the spatial resolution of the data."
