    "### Information about the world\n",
    "When we look at the world, we can see things like buildings, trees, rivers, and rocks. We can watch birds flying in the sky, fish swimming in a lake, cars and buses driving past on a road. We can hear the sounds of flowing water, branches rustling in the wind, waves rolling pebbles on a beach. We can smell the salty air near the sea, or the smoky air near a fire. We can feel the warmth or cold in the air or the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can appreciate these things, enjoy them - or not, in some cases. Depending on what we see, hear, smell, or feel, we can make choices, take decisions, or do actions. That's because everything we can see, hear, smell, or feel is *information* about the world. It's *data*. How we feel about it, or what we do about it - that's because our brains are taking that data, perhaps combining it with other information that we already know, and processing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a bus driving down the road, and decide that now is really not a good time to start crossing the road. We can hear the sound of raindrops hitting windows, and put a coat on before opening the door to go outside. We can smell burning food, and rush to the cooker to pull a pot off the heat<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). We can see a ball flying towards us, calculate where and when it's going to be close to us, and put out a hand to catch it. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this, we often take for granted, but it's really astonishing just how powerful our brains are, and how much information they can process so quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That includes information about what's happening in our environment. We can identify different kinds of rocks, and even use small changes to figure out the geological history of an area - even over hundreds of millions of years: that's how the geological timescale was first constructed back in the 1800s. We can see a cloudless sky, feel the warmth in the air, and remember smelling smoke in the air from a forest on a previous similar day. We can identify species of animals and plants, hear their calls, see signs of disease. We can write these observations down, track them over days, weeks, months, years and longer figure out what weather conditions make wildfires more likely, and where. To record how populations of plants and animals are affected as towns and cities grow, or as farming practices change. To notice that we're having to plant crops a couple of weeks later these days, that October isn't really as cold as it used to be, or that we're having more storms per year than we did in the past. With just our own senses, we can discover an astonishing amount about the natural world - and we have.\n",

    "### Sensors\n",
    "However astonishing it might be though, our senses have limits. We can see red, green, and blue light, anything in between, or any combinations; but we can't see infrared or X-rays, or any objects smaller than about 0.1mm, and we can't say exactly how tall a tree or building is. We can't hear sounds below 20Hz or above 20kHz. We can't smell how much carbon dioxide is in the air - and even things we can smell, like smoke, only gives us a very rough estimate of how much we're smelling. We can't even feel if something is wet (really! When we feel something and think it's wet, we're actually just judging that based on texture and temperature, not the wetness itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also limited by where we are. We can only see what's in front of us, as far as the horizon; closer, if something's in the way. We can hear from all directions, but not very far. We might be only just able to make out what a friend 180m away is saying, but no further - and even closer if it's noisy around us. We can't smell something if the wind is blowing it away from us. We can only feel what we can physically touch. And that's assuming all of our senses are working in perfect condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we're not limited by our own senses. We can feel the cold, hear the rain, and see the branches swaying in the wind - and use a thermometer to measure the temperature, a gauge to measure the rainfall, and an anemometer and vane to measure the wind speed and direction. Also a barometer to measure the air pressure, a laser rangefinder to measure the height of the tree - and the same elsewhere to see how these all change over distance. We can measure the carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate pollution in the air; track how water level rises and falls in rivers after certain amounts of rainfall in different places; use infrared cameras and more to see what our eyes can't, and put them on satellites to see more at once than we ever possibly could.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advances in technology and computing over the past couple of decades has brought us to a point where the level of information about the natural world we can collect as data makes the word \"astonishing\" seem just... too ordinary. Sensors for recording various kinds of data can now be mass produced with costs cheap enough to put them wherever they might be useful. Individual sensors for measurements like temperature, air pressure, humidity can cost just pennies. They need to be combined with electronics to power and read them, but even so, instruments which were once only available to professional organisations with significant budgets can now be easily obtained by almost everyone. Want your own weather station? You can buy a solar powered one that will wirelessly upload all its data to a free online dashboard for less than €100. A seismograph to monitor earthquakes can cost as little as €160. Even where the costs of equipment are still only within the budgets of large organisations - satellites, for example - the high speed internet means that anyone and everyone can have the same access to their data as the professionals.

    "### Geospatial data\n",
    "Crucially, for information about the environment, this has included advances in determining *where* things are. For thousands of years, people have been making maps, but the launch of the GPS satellite network starting in 1978 fundamentally changed everything - and the falling costs have long since made it available to everyone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, almost all of us have smartphones in our pockets which can locate where we are on the surface of the Earth to within 5 metres - and show us a satellite image and map of what's around us. Professional equipment can get that down to just one centimeter or even better - and that's only 'professional' equipment because most people don't need it, not because it's too expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's now so cheap and easy to record a location, we don't just have data about the natural world: we have geospatial data. It's not just that a thermometer can measure the temperature; we can also now easily record precisely where and when that temperature was recorded, and map that with similar readings in many different places over long periods of time - along with whatever other data we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're not really limited anymore by the technology. We're pretty much at a point where almost anyone can collect or find geospatial data for almost anything they want to. To put it simply, in terms of what we might want to know about the natural world, it's not about what geospatial information we're *able* to record anymore - it's about what geospatial information we *want* to record.

    "### Processing\n",
    "Just like our senses, our brains have limits too, and this amount of data is just far too much for our brains to process. Spot the patterns in pressure, temperature, and humidity changes? Maybe, but if you have one reading per second, and several years of data? From multiple locations? It's just too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where computers can come in - and what modern computers can do is almost overwhelming. The computer I'm writing this on can do something in the range of 76,728,000,000 calculations per second. Whatever data can be collected by sensors or people, computers can analyse faster and in much more detail than any person ever could. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with data collection, it's also not really about what's *possible* to do - sure, there's some limits there, but those limits are now so far away that it's really about what you *want* to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of you taking this module, there will be different things you're interested in. Some might want to look at whether particular places will be at risk of flooding in the future, while others might be more interested in looking at biodiversity of places, or how buildings and roads might be changing temperature patterns through the urban heat island effect, or whether existing bus routes are enough to serve the population living in particular places. I'm sure some of you will be thinking \"I'm not interested in any of those\", but will have completely different things you'd be interested in doing. That's fine, and I am looking forward to hearing what you're each interested in looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it would be a bit of a challenge to cover everything in six weeks, to put it mildly - but I'll do my best to cover what's interesting to each of you, and give you all the opportunity to cover the basics, so that if you want to do something different in the future, you'll at least know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data analysis means using computers to process geolocated data in order to better understand what is happening in the world. There's two aspects to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first aspect is that computers need to be told what to do - which we call programming. This can be done by writing instructions in a form the computer can understand - which we'd call a programming language. Of course, a lot of the time, the instructions have already been written out and packaged by other people into a computer programme - also known as software, or as an app. To read this, you had to at least open a browser and click on a link. That means you used a basic set of instructions (which control how all the various components of the computer work together) called an operating system. You used this to turn on the computer, log in, and run a second set of instructions for how to communicate with other computers over the internet, and how to display the data received - that's your web browser, maybe Chrome or Firefox or Edge. One of those bits of data received was a link to this page, and the programme instructions told the computer to get the data for this page from where it's stored, and how to show that on your screen - the size of the text, the colour of the background, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "For analysis of geospatial data, we can write instructions ourselves in a programming language, such as Python, Julia, Rust, or R. Or, we can use instructions previously written by other people with software such as QGIS or ArcGIS. There's even instructions which form web pages you can use in a browser, like Felt, Earth Engine, Binder, and Colab - which is what you're using now. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are your tools. Which tool you need or want to use depends on what you want to do, and how you want to do it. I plan to give you an introduction to some of these tools, and hopefully I can help you decide what you want to do and use. Some of you are complete beginners to this, and will need a bit more guidance, and that's absolutely normal. Some of you have done some of this before, and might want to learn something different. Either way, I plan to give everyone the opportunity to develop some new skills in something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second aspect is that the data needs to be in a form which the computer can understand and use. This generally means giving the data to the computer in a file or format which matches a format already in its instructions - just like how Word understands how to open and display a written document, while Excel knows how to open and display a spreadsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's also about the different things that computers can do with different kinds of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how best to do that, it's important to first understand how different information about the real world can be represented as different types of data - and how computers handle data of different types. So, that's what this Notebook will explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook, as all the notebooks in this module, uses the Python programming language, but much the same will apply to other programming languages and software."
