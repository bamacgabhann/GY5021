    "## 1. Coordinates and map projections\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with maps is that the Earth is round - while maps are flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossible to unfold a round shape like the Earth onto a flat surface without distorting at least one of shapes, areas, distances, and angles. Simply can't be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that every map you'll ever see is wrong, in some way. No flat map can every be completely accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's step back for a second, and look at coordinates. The coordinates used for the Earth on a global scale are latitude and longitude. Lines of latitude are parallel to the equator, while lines of longitude run from pole to pole. Latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the equator, going from -90 at the south pole to +90 at the north pole; longitude is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian, going from 0 to 180 as you move east, and from 0 to -180 as you move west.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth.svg/652px-Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth.svg.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a couple of important things to point out here. Lines of latitude are parallel - but they are not equal in length. The equator goes around the entire circumference of the Earth, its widest point - but lines of latitude then get smaller as you move north or south, reducing to zero length at the Poles. Lines of longitude, on the other hand, *are* all the same length, running from Pole to Pole, each having the full circumference of the Earth - but they aren't parallel, with the distance between them being widest at the equator, and reducing to zero at the Poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a degree of longitude will cover the same distance on the ground, regardless of where you are in the world - but a degree of latutide is a much bigger distance near the equator than near the poles, where it reduces towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a basic map of the world by ignoring this, and treating degrees of latitude and longitude as if they were constant measures of distance, and directly using them as X and Y coordinates - making the lines of longitude parallel.\n"

His map therefore applied an equal amount of north-south stretching as east-west stretching. It's known now as the Mercator projection, and it's probably the world map you're used to seeing."

    "Notice the numbers around the map there. The general coordinate system used globally is latitude and longitude, measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the equator, and east or west of the Greenwitch Meridian. That's the most useful system for global use, but it has a disadvantage in that 360 degrees around the lines of latitude varies from zero at the poles, to the full circumference of the planet around the equator. In other words, a degree is a measurement of angle from the centre of the Earth, but it's *not* a consistent measure of distance.\n",

This makes it extremely useful for local work - if you have two coordinates, you can tell how far apart they are in metres simply by subtracting the numbers. It makes calculating distances and areas much easier. It is the preferred coordinate system for Ireland, and should be used for virtually all maps of Ireland."

    "2. Making sure your data is in the right map projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one to use is going to be fairly straightforward, honestly, even though it sounds complicated. Does your map only show part of Ireland? Then use ITM. Does it show only part of another country? Then find that country's system. Europe-wide? LAEA. Global? Mercator if you're showing routes, like shipping or flights, Gall-Peters if you're showing area-density numbers like population density, availability of healthcare etc., and Mollweide if you're showing a global dataset like surface temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing is going to be ensuring that all your data is in the right coordinate reference system. You might have some data from the CSO using ITM, a base map from Google in Mercator, some EPA data in the old Irish Grid (the system used before ITM. It's been defunct for 20 years, but still some people use it, I don't know what to tell you), and some European data in LAEA. You need to get it all into the same system, so that you can most effectively use all the data together.\n",
