    "\n",
    "The Python language itself is fairly small. It really just contains the basic level of instructions to define the basic different kinds of data, how to work with text and do basic maths, and work with protocols like http for using the internet and similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Python so very useful isn't just this fundamental core of the language - it's that thousands of people have written packages in Python to do other things - from slightly more specific maths, all the way to advanced machine learning and AI tasks. Most of these are open source, and you can install them and use them in your projects. The official repository for Python packages is [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), the Python Package Index, which currently contains 509,528 projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this adds a complication. The core Python language - called the Standard Library - is updated annually. We're on version 3.12 now, released last October. Version 3.13 is available as a development version now, while new features are being added, and is scheduled for official release next October. 3.14 will be expected in October 2025. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all the open source packages published by other groups and individuals can't all follow such a strict annual update timeline. Most are written by unpaid volunteer contributors, who will add and update whenever they can find the time, but there's only so many hours in a day, and people have their own lives going on as well. This means that packages are normally updated on a completely different schedule to the language itself, and to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, sometimes you'll have a project using Package A for Python 3.10 which relies on Package B; and another project using Package C, which relies on an ealier version of Package A for Python 3.6 and hasn't been updated yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these conflicts, we can set up what are called _Virtual Environments_ for each project. A virtual environment is basically a folder on your computer which contains a specific version of Python, and the specific versions of all the packages you need for that project. When you activate that environment to work on it, you're essentially just telling your computer \"use the version of Python, and the versions of the packages, which are in this particular folder\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this means you can keep your work on different projects separate, and won't get caught out by problems caused by needing different things for different projects.\n",

    "Handling the conflicts between dependencies of various packages could be a nightmare, but fortunately you don't have to go and find the right versions of packages on PyPI yourself. There are a number of tools for package management, which check the compatibility of all the packages you need for a project and automatically install the right versions. These are often the same tools you'll use to create virtual environments, since the two needs overlap significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which tool is the best for you will depend heavily on your personal preferences, needs, and workflow. Unfortunately, you don't usually know what those will be until you've been using Python for a while, but in order to use Python for a while first you need to have tools for virtual environments and package management. So you need to choose something before you're ready, and of course changing later can be awkward. \n",

On Windows, you can install [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and use it to create new environments, install packages in those environments, and open an IDE (see below) - Jupyter, PyCharm, or Spyder. \n",

    "There is one quirk to using Anaconda. I said that PyPI is the official repository for Python packages - but conda doesn't use it. Instead, conda has its own repository, which it refers to as the ```conda default``` channel. But the default channel only has selected versions of more mainstream packages. Many of the packages you might need for geospatial analysis aren't there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, there is a more open channel to which anyone can publish packages, called ```conda-forge```. Many geospatial python packages can be found on conda-forge. \n",
    "\n",
    "When conda works, it's very simple. The problem is that conda-forge has so many packages that working out the dependencies, so that you can install a compatible set of packages for a project, can take a long time. Now, don't get me wrong - for many people, it still works just fine. But, for me, for the particular things I'd be using, this has reached epic nightmare proportions which have caused me to get over my otherwise pathological resistance to change, and trying a completely different workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Windows, and unless you're very comfortable with using the command line to type commands, I would probably still recommend using Anaconda. You'll need to add conda-forge as a channel, and then re-add the default channel to make sure the default channel has higher priority, otherwise you'll end up with installations taking forever. If you're getting more into it, it will probably be worth installing the mamba package manager as well - but only go there once you're getting quite familiar with everything, don't overcomplicate things too soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will tell you what my current workflow is, but bear in mind that I normally use Linux for everything I do with Python. There are Windows versions for most of what I use (and I found [this blog](https://endjin.com/blog/2023/03/how-to-setup-python-pyenv-poetry-on-windows) which shows how to set up much the same as what I do but on Windows), but I would recommend sticking to Anaconda unless you're comfortable with the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are comfortable with the command line, or are very serious about developing coding skills, I would actually recommend skipping the Windows command line and [installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) - which allows you to run Linux on a Windows computer, at the same time. But this will come with a LOT of things to learn, so again, only if you're really serious about it or already use Linux.\n",
