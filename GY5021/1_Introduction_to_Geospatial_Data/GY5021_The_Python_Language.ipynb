    "This Notebook is going to throw a *lot* at you all at once. Don't expect, or even *try*, to fully understand and remember all of this in one go. My purpose in writing this for you is to give you an introduction, so that when you see certain things next, they won't be brand new to you - and you'll be able to refer back to this for reference. Some of these concepts will only really make sense once you've used them for yourself, or at least until you've seen them in real action a few times. If you want to, you'll get there. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you install python, you're installing what's called the Standard Library - the basic set of tools which comprises the python language (https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not where the power of python lies. Rather, the power lies in the numerous packages - 509,528 currently listed on PyPI, the Python Packaging Index - which have already been written for python, for everything from the simplest operations all the way to machine learning and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python package is a collection of modules which have been written for a common purpose - to do something specific. In this course, we'll use a few different Python packages, such as pandas for working with tables of data, and matplotlib for drawing graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Python module is a file containing Python code, which defines classes of data, and methods for working with that data. For example, the ```datetime``` module includes classes of date and time data, and methods for working with these dates and times. Some Python packages will just have a single module, but others will have several different modules for different aspects of what the package is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script is a single Python file with code for a specific purpose. You run the script to do something. If you run a module or a package, all that happens is that the different classes of data and methods for working with that data in that module or package are loaded by Python. There won't be anything produced. But a script might use some methods defined in a module or package to work with some particular data, and produce an output, like a graph, or saving a file containing processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want your Python script to be able to use classes of data or methods from a particular package or module, you have to install the package, and then you have to import it."

Loading elements requires memory, so to keep memory use low, you only bring in what's needed. So the first part of virtually every python file is doing just that, via import statements.\n",

    "To understand why Python is such a powerful language, you have to understand something of programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classic, old-school languages like FORTRAN - which my mother used in the 1970s - are _compiled_ languages. There's still a lot of these around - FORTRAN is still there, albeit rare, as is PASCAL; C is the basis of much of modern computer architecture, with the C++ and C# variants; there's even new compiled languages, for example Rust, which will probably be my next language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages take the code you have written and translate it to machine-readable byte code before you can run it. This compilation is heavily dependant on machine architecture and operating system - which is why you have different versions of software for PC, Mac, and Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of compiling code is that it's fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that you have to be very specific about everything: for example, if you want a variable, you have to specify what kind of data it will hold, and how much memory it will take up. This means compiled languages are generally not particularly user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a _dynamic_ language - it's not compiled. Instead, when you run a python script, it is passed to the Python Interpreter (which is written and compiled in C), which translates the code and runs it. This intermediate step means you have a lot more latitude. You can assign variables, change their type, change their size - and the interpreter will deal with all the management.\n",

    "Now, note two things here. First, range(30) started at 0 and went up to 29. This is how numbers work in many aspects of python - indexes start at 0, not 1, and usually go up to n-1 for the number you type in. So list[4] is the _fifth_ item of a list, not the fourth, because there's also list[0], list[1], list[2], and list[3]. \n",

Simply open with f\" rather than just \", and you can put variables in braces within the string: {}.\n",

As I said at the top, don't expect to have understood all of this, and remember it perfectly - but you've seen some of the core basics now, so they'll be less new when they come up next, and you can refer back to this at any time. You'll very likely want to refer back to it a lot."
