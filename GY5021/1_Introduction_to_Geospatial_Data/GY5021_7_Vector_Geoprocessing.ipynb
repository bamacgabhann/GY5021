    "\n",
    "I'm not entirely convinced that map is hugely useful either. Not on a national scale, anyway. If we were looking at, say, Dublin, or Limerick, in isolation, trying to see if bus routes were working in certain places, then yes, doing this would be appropriate. But on a national scale, it's probably more useful to just see the average numbers for particular places.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, what we'd probably be most interested in, at a national level, is the proportion of people using sustainable transport options in urban areas - because of course, as we can see on the map above, rural areas really aren't - there just aren't any practical sustainable options right now for most rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by what's called *dissolving* the data - meaning merging all features which share some attribute in common. To look at the sustainable transport options in each urban area, we will dissolve the data by the ```SA_URBAN_AREA_NAME``` column, which contains the names of the urban area each small area is part of - if they are part of one. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in the ```head``` table above that the first couple of small areas in the list are part of Carlow town. The dissolve method will merge these all to a single feature - combining the polygon shapes for each small area in Carlow town. There will be a separate feature combining all the small areas in Limerick, and one for Galway, and one for Sligo...and so on. Each urban area named will get a single row combining all the data from all rows where that urban area was previously named.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, that means there'll only be one cell to contain population data, rather than one cell for each small area - and the same for every other column. So we also have to specify how this will be handled. Since we want the average for each urban area, we could take the mean of all the values for each urban area, and save the total in the relevant new row. \n",

    "However, that would also take the mean for all the other data columns, which isn't appropriate. But we also don't *need* all of those other columns for this.\n",
