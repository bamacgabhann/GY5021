    "\n",
    "But how do we get our real geospatial data into whatever tool we're using? How do we save geospatial data to a file? \n",

    "Word documents use ```.docx``` files, but not all word processors do, OpenOffice uses ```.odx``` files for example. Is geospatial data like that, with different programs having different ways of saving files? Can some software only open certain files?\n",

    "Well, it's both simpler and more complicated than that, but the good news is that most geospatial tools will be able to read most forms of geospatial data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The less good news is that there's a few different formats you should get familiar with. I'll discuss 5 different vector geospatial formats here in particular."

    "The reason for this is ultimately the same as the 10-character limit for column names, and the lack of support for datetime columns. The shapefile format was created in the 1980s when GIS started. Computers in the 1980s were far less powerful than modern computers, and so, over time as more was possible in GIS, more data was needed to be saved than the original shapefile format allowed. Rather than changing to a new format, the format was simply extended to save the additional information in these *sidecar* files. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is very irritating. True, it's just a minor irritation, but every year since I started teaching GIS, I've had an issue where a student comes to me in a panic saying \"my map has stopped working, help!\". And when I go to help them, I see that their data folder has the ```.shp``` file, but none of the additional sidecar files. \"Oh\", will say the student, \"I noticed all those extra files in the folder and I wanted to tidy it up, so I deleted them all\". \n",

    "Even all these minor irritations aren't the main reason not to use shapfiles. The main reason not to use the format is that it's horribly slow and memory inefficient. There are formats which take up less space, and are literally hundreds of times faster than shapefiles. The amount of compute time across the world wasted due to reading and writing shapefiles probably accounts for a measurable amount of climate change. \n",
    "\n",
