    "# Temporal Change: Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *Active Remote Sensing* Notebook, we looked at change over time with raster data, using SAR satellite imagery collected months and years apart to map floods in Athlone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change over time is not limited to raster data - and census data is an excellent example of that. Population estimates for Ireland have been made since the population was counted at 1,100,000 in 1672, and the first full census of Ireland was taken in 1821. From 1841 to 1911, a census was undertaken every decade. Following the War of Independence, the first census of the State as it is today was taken in 1926, continuing at 10-year intervals until the interval was reduced to 5 years from 1951 onwards. The most recent census was delayed by a year due to the COVID pandemic, with the data published last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The census doesn't just count the number of people. If you were living in Ireland on Census night - 03 April 2022 - you should have filled in the form, and so you might have seen the range of questions. In addition to the number of people present in a household on census night, there were questions about the age, sex, marital status, place of birth, ethnicity, religion, languages spoken, health, commuting and travel, education, and employment for each person. There were also questions about the household - the age of the building, ownership or rental, provision of energy and water supply, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, the census forms are specific for each address. This means that we don't just know who, but also where - and we can put that on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because we have census data going back decades, we can also map changes in the data over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need ```pandas```, ```geopandas```, ```numpy```, and ```matplotlib``` for this Notebook."

The forms for the census are tied to individual addresses, but it would be quite intrusive to publish the individual data - which includes answers to how much people earn, when they travel to work, and other sensitive information. So, the data has to be collated to be shared, in order to protect everyone's privacy. Collating the data over large areas can obscure useful information, though - for example, if you want to see whether people are using a particular bus service. The small areas are essentially the compromise: publishing the data for quite small geographic areas, but not so small that individual people's answers could be identified.\n",

We can't say the bus is faster if we're just comparing distances travelled over different durations of time - or if it's a different bus. We can't say a child is getting taller if we measure a child's height one year, and a different child's height the next year. Has to be the same child, obviously. Similarly, for census areas, if the population grows *and* the area changes, what's staying the same? \n",

First, that you have to be careful when working with census data that you're comparing like with like; since some of the small areas change each time, that needs to be accounted for. The fact that the small areas map data contains GUIDs for 2022 and 2016 means that this is generally possible for the most recent censuses, but is awkward in cases where areas have been split or reconfigured because it's not possible to know *how* areas have been split or reconfigured. Secondly, it means that the further back you go, the less data you will usefully have, because of the greater changes to the areas. \n",

I deleted all the areas with significant changes. So it's definitely an oversimplified example, and you won't be able to do that everywhere. \n",

    "There's not really any easy way to account for the changes to the small areas themselves, unless the CSO actually republish the 2016 census data using the 2022 small areas. That's unlikely, unfortunately, because they have too much work to do already on the new data - not all the 2022 results are released yet, and they're already developing the next census for 2026.\n",

There were 3409 EDs in 2016, and 3420 in 2022 - an increase of 11, I think all due to the expansion of Cork City - although there were a small number of other tweaks as well. This makes them useful for comparing census data over time. They do have two drawbacks though: first, since they're historic areas, and so their populations vary wildly, from fewer than 10 people to multiple thousands; and second, for the same reason, their the areas covered by different EDs also vary wildly, from a few city blocks to areas larger than entire cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Electoral Areas are the new districts from which local councillors are elected. These are revised from time to time based on population changes, so they're less useful for comparison - but of course it's useful to look at them in terms of them being areas represented by councillors, and so subject to political attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Administrative Counties are the areas covered by local Councils. These are not changed regularly, although it's not all that long since Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council were merged into Limerick City and County Council. There's some large-scale change comparisons possible, but they're too large for a lot of possible change over time analyses.\n",

    "The key point here is that if you want to show change over time in vector data, at the core it's no different from showing any other vector data. You need two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. vector geometry\n",
    "2. data in an attribute column\n",
    "\n",
    "just like any other vector map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference is in *where the attribute data comes from*. Normally, it will involve some simple maths - subtracting data for the earlier date from the data for the later date. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complicated part, as in the example above, is in ensuring the data for both dates refers to exactly the same geometry shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's simple examples where this is less of an issue - for example if you want to illustrate data for countries, it's mostly straightforward, although you do need to watch out for examples like East and West Germany. \n",
    "\n",
    "But for census data (and of course the same might apply to other examples), this isn't straightforward, and often requires a lot of checking and data cleaning to get the data into a usable format."
